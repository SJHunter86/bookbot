# Bookbot - A Boot.dev Project

Bookbot is a simple Python script that takes a .txt file, in this case a book, and prints
a report including the number of words in the book, and the character frequency in descending order.

## Description

This is the first of several projects offered at boot.dev. I am going through the whole curriculum
using VIM motions as a way of training myself to use them. This project is the first step towards
building a functional working pace in neovim to improve my workflow.
